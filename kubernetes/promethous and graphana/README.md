<!-- Monitoring -->

- Promethous is used to colect metircs.
- Graphana is used for visualization.
- Promethous retirves the metrices, graphana grabs the metrices statics and make visualization.
- Promethous can be used standalone but graphana provides rich in visualization.
- Why promethous for visualization, because it is very dynamic enviornment and cope well with k8's.
- Before it we need to have dynamic volume provising enabled.(PV and PVC), because promethous have to save the metrics logs.
- Once that is completed add the promethous repo by using **helm add repo <repo_name>**
- **helm update repo**
- Download and save the values file.
- **helm inspect values prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack > prometheus.yml**
- Update the values as requied like port, storageClass and sevice type.
- **helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --values prometheus.yml**
- The will install prometheus and graphana
- **kubectl port-forward deployment/prometheus-grafana 3000**
- Now graphana dashboard will be available in 3000 port localhost.
- Use the username and password specifeid in the values file and login.
- Add data source in graphana and we are good to go.
- Add dashboard in graphana.
- Or we can import prebult dashbaord by searching graphan dashboards and using the dashboard id to impor the dashboard.
